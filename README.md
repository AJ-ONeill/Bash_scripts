# RHCSA Labs & Study Notes

This repository contains my hands-on labs, notes, and practice scripts as I prepare for the **Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA)** exam.

I’m following a structured 8-week plan using **Sander van Vugt’s course** and **Asghar Ghori’s book**, with real-time lab practice and personal documentation.
